Step 1: Set Up GitHub Repository (Due: 11/21)
Create a GitHub repository (name it something like p5js-shape-project).
Add a README.md:
Write a short description of the project:
Draw 10+ shapes or vertices.
Animate their properties (position, color, size).
Use conditional logic (e.g., shapes bounce off walls).
Commit the file.
Step 2: Set Up Basic Code (Due: 11/21)
Create a file called sketch.js.
Paste in the basic p5.js setup from editor.p5js.org.
Commit this file.
Step 3: Build the Program (Ongoing: 11/22 and after)
Start Small:

Draw one shape (like a circle).
Animate one property (e.g., make it move).
Commit.
Add More Shapes:

Add more shapes until you have 10+.
Commit.
Add Conditional Logic:

Make shapes bounce off walls or change color when they reach a certain position.
Commit.
Finish Up:

Test everything to make sure it works.
Add more advanced features (if time permits).
